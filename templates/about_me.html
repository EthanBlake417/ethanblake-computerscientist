									<p>Hi! I'm Ethan. I graduated form Oregon State University in 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I graduated from
										Arizona State University in 2018 with a B.S. in Vocal Performance. I work as Software Engineer for Grid Evolution Technologies,
										and as a TA for Data Structures at OSU. I enjoy playing a variety of musical instruments, a variety of sports,
										and traveling, with frequent trips to DisneyLand! </p>
<!--									<p>Hello! I am Ethan Blake. I grew up in Phoenix Arizona and come from a large family of 10. I am the fifth child out of eight,-->
<!--										so I ended up being the hobbyist of the family, spending most of my childhood playing sports and music. In fact, due to a nice scholarship offer-->
<!--										I decided to go to Arizona State University for a bachelor's degree in vocal performance. In 2018, I graduated (and got married!), but struggled-->
<!--										to find consistent income in music, so I ended up working other odd jobs, including an assembly line job for Axon (Taser) and a sales job-->
<!--										for State Farm.</p>-->

<!--									<p>Soon after I graduated with my degree in Vocal performance and got married, I was involved in a traumatic car accident. In fact,-->
<!--										the passenger of the driver that hit me ended up dying! I came out okay, except I sustained some significant neck and brain damage which-->
<!--										manifest themselves in nonsensical pains I feel in my face and neck. Because of the nonsensical pains I haven't been able to sing without significant-->
<!--										pain since the accident. The pain, combined with working a few jobs that I disliked motivated me to find a new career.</p>-->

<!--									<p>When the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020 I lost my job working for Axon, so I decided I might go to a coding bootcamp, but as things turned out-->
<!--										I was able to pursue a Post-Baccalaureate at Oregon State University in Computer Science, while I worked for Grid Evolution Technologies in a-->
<!--										programming role. </p>-->

<!--									<p>Looking back, I never would have wanted that car accident to happen; I still deal with some nerve pain, and I really miss singing,-->
<!--										but in a lot of ways, I'm so thankful for the hard circumstances that lead me to get a Bachelor's in computer science. I've always enjoyed skill building and learning,-->
<!--										whether the skill is as simple as jumping rope, as complicated as singing, or as cool as solving puzzles. I've found programming to be about-->
<!--										as fun as singing and perhaps even more satisfying.</p>-->

<!--									<p>Currently, I'm most interested in either Machine Learning or Computer Engineering, but in all honesty as long as I am learning new things-->
<!--										I enjoy just about everything in the CS world.</p>-->
